Chemics
=======

The Chemics_ package is a collection of Python functions for performing
calculations in the field of chemical and fluidization engineering. Source
code for the package is available on GitHub_ and contributions from the
community are encouraged.

Installation
------------

If you don't have Python installed on your computer, the Anaconda_ or
Miniconda_ distribution of Python is recommended for scientific computing.
After setting up Python, the Chemics package can be downloaded and installed
using the pip or conda package managers.

Install Chemics using the pip package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install chemics

Install Chemics using the conda package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
   $ conda install chemics

Usage
-----

The example below imports the Chemics package then uses the :code:`rhog()`
function to calculate the density of a gas based on its molecular weight,
pressure, and temperature.

.. code-block:: python

    import chemics as cm

    cm.rhog(28, 170100, 773)

The :code:`ut()` function calculates the terminal velocity of a particle
according to the Haider and Levenspiel 1989 paper as shown below.

.. code-block:: python

    import chemics as cm

    # Parameters
    dp = 0.00016    # particle diameter [m]
    mu = 1.8e-5     # gas viscosity [kg/(m s)]
    phi = 0.67      # particle sphericity [-]
    rhog = 1.2      # gas density [kg/m^3]
    rhos = 2600     # particle density [kg/m^3]

    # Haider and Levenspiel terminal velocity [m/s]
    ut_haider = cm.ut_haider(dp, mu, phi, rhog, rhos)

Use the :code:`ChemicalEquation` class to get properties of the reactants and
products from a given chemical equation.

.. code-block:: python

    import chemics as cm

    ce = cm.ChemicalEquation('2 HCl + 2 Na -> 2 NaCl + H2')

    ce.balance
    # returns True for balanced equation

    ce.rct_properties
    # returns a dataframe of the reactant properties
    #                HCl        Na
    # moles            2         2
    # species        HCl        Na
    # molwt       36.458     22.99
    # mass        72.916     45.98
    # molfrac        0.5       0.5
    # massfrac  0.613275  0.386725
