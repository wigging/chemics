Gas
===

Gas properties such as density, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity can be calculated using the methods available in the :code:`Gas` class. Some methods are based on correlations and are named accordingly; for example, the :code:`cp_yaws()` method uses Yaws' coefficients to calculate the heat capacity for a range of temperatures.
