Pressure drop
=================

Pressure drop is defined as the difference in total pressure between two points
of a fluid carrying network. A pressure drop occurs when frictional forces, 
caused by the resistance to flow, act on a fluid as it flows through a tube.

The equation presented by Ergun, based on an extensive set of experimental data
covering a wide range of particle size and shapes, calculates the pressure
drop across a packed bed for all flow conditions (laminar to turbulent).
